# Here is where to search for the variables of this class.
# Syntax depends on whether crate/word = "crate" or "word".
# If "crate", we are looking into crates by slot and channel.
# if "word", we are looking at a position relative to a header.
# Hence, either:
# name     "crate"   crate-number    slot    channel
# or:
# name     "word"    crate-number    header  num-to-skip
# For the latter case, if one specifies crate-number = 0, then the
# entire event is searched for 'header' (which in this case must be unique).
# If crate-number > 0, then only that crate is searched.
#
# If this file is not existing, THaDecData will use its own internal DefaultMap().
